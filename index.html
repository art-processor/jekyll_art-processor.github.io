        <h4>Variability  Management  Techniques  (VMT)</h4>
        <p>
        help  developers  manage the  base  code  for  families  of  system variants,  e.g.,  a  family  of  Linux  versions  running  on  various  platforms,  or  financial  systems  used  in  different companies.

        <h4>Frame technology (FT)</h4>
        <p> is a language-neutral (i.e., processes various languages) system that manufactures custom software from reusable, machine-adaptable building blocks, called frames. FT is used to reduce the time, effort, and errors involved in the design, construction, and evolution of large, complex software systems.

      ART is here to help you automate common every day software engineering task through code generation and to help you eliminate human coding mistakes and achieve better code quality. However almost all our examples will talk about examples and usage in software engineering, ART has been proven to be useful in other aspects as well. In example for description to image generation (link, desc) and mass document handling (link, desc).

      <h1> How it Works </h1>
    </header>
     <p>
     ART is a simple text processor, reads text files line by line and outputs text files. If the current line in the currently read file is an ART command <span class="art-command-span">(#[cmd])</span>, it will be processed, otherwise it will be emitted to the output.
     </p>
     <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
         <h4>Adapting input files</h4>
         <p>
         The ART Processor starts processing with the start file a.k.a specification (SPC) file. ART commands in the start file, and in each subsequently adapted file, are processed in the sequence in which they appear. Whenever the processor encounters an <span class="art-command-span">#adapt</span> command in the currently processed file, processing of the current file is suspended and the Processor starts processing the given file. Once processing of the file is completed, the Processor resumes processing of the current file just after <span class="art-command-span">#adapt</span> command. In that way the processing ends when the Processor reaches the end of the start file.

      <h1> Usage and Examples </h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Let's see how ART can be applied with some simple code snippet examples.
      The ART language like other languages allows us to declare and use variables. Let's look at the following simple example:
    </p>
    <h5>ART snippet:</h5>
    <textarea id="snippet-1" class="codearea">
    #set var_a = "AAA"
    Value of var_a is: ?@var_a?
    </textarea>
    <h5>Result:</h5>
    <textarea id="snippet-2" class="codearea">
    Value of var_a is: AAA
    </textarea>
    <br>
    As we can see, variables can be allocated with the <span class="art-command-span">#set</span> command followed by declaration, and their value can be retrieved with <span class="art-ref-span">?@varname?</span> syntax.
    <p> Let's see a slightly more sophisticated example with the two commands we've learned know so far (<span class="art-command-span">#adapt</span> and <span class="art-command-span">#set</span>) </p>
    <h5>ART snippet:</h5>
    <textarea id="snippet-3" class="codearea">
    #set date              = "2016-12-22"
    #set my_name           = "Peter Griffin"
    #set authorized_name   = "Meg Griffin"
    #set lawyer_name       = "Dr. Saul"
    #set days_valid        = "30"
    %All setting done, now we adapt the template file
    #adapt "template.art"
    </textarea>
    <h5>template.art:</h5>
    <textarea id="snippet-4" class="codearea">
    Authorization Letter

    I ?@my_name? hereby authorize ?@authorized_name? to collect my
    property documents from my lawyer ?@lawyer_name?.
    This authorization letter is valid for ?@days_valid? days from
    the issuance date after which it becomes null and void.
    For security purposes, I have attested below the signature
    of the authorized person.

    _________ ?@my_name?

    _________ ?@authorized_name?     (?@date?)
    </textarea>
    <h5>Result:</h5>
    <textarea id="snippet-5" class="codearea">
    Authorization Letter

    I Peter Griffin hereby authorize Meg Griffin to collect my
    property documents from my lawyer Dr. Saul.
    This authorization letter is valid for 30 days from
    the issuance date after which it becomes null and void.
    For security purposes, I have attested below the signature

    <p>However we have not written source code yet, we can already have an idea of where to use this kind of technology. In the earlier example we can identify a declaration part and a template part. First we set up our values we want to use, then we <b>adapt</b> the template with our variables to get the result we were expecting.</p>
    <p>Since the template does not care about our specific settings, it can be used by others, with different values without any changes on the template.
    I can run this with my own set of values, then my neighbor can run it with his own set of values, we both get the output we wanted, even though we were running the through the same template without any changes to it.</p>
    <p>This looks kinda useful, but it is not that convincing...</p>
    <h4>Let's shake it up a bit! Let's see a new command!</h4>
    <p>We can give multiple values to a variable with a <span class="art-command-span">#set</span> command, by defining the values separated by comma. These variables in ART are called multi-variables.<br>Our new command is <span class="art-command-span">#while</span>. This command will let us loop over the values of a multi-value variable. Let's see it:</p>
    <h5>ART snippet:</h5>
    <textarea id="snippet-6" class="codearea">
    #set class       = "SwordsMan", "Archer", "Knight"
    #set hp          = "25",        "15".     "150"

    %All setting done, now we adapt the template file

    <p>OK... Getting closer to useful... Let's modify our code.<br>Let's say it is time to add another class to it called <i>'Mage'</i>. Now to do that we only need to make a very small change in our definition and we don't need to change the template code at all. Let's see:</p>
    <h5>ART snippet (added Mage class and values):</h5>
    <textarea id="snippet-9" class="codearea">

    <br>
    <p>That was fast and easy, and no copy-paste errors. Great!</p>
    <p>Now it is starting to boost our productivity and we don't need to swipe over in the code if anything changes in the template. We just know it is correct.</p>
    <p>Imagine this being applied on thousands of lines of code templates...</p>
    <p style="color:red">"Sure sure, that is pretty cool, but my classes are never like this, my code always differs, I cannot apply the same code on every file."</p>
    <p>I know, Let's add a small change to our code! Let's say some warrior classes will have special attack, some will not have, and the ones who have, will have different ones.</p>
    <p>We need to learn two new commands for this. We will use the <span class="art-command-span">#insert</span> - <span class="art-command-span">#break</span> mechanism</p>
    <p>Our template will have a <b>breakpoint</b> where we can extend with additional content from our <b>specification</b>, meaning, we can change the template from outside the template without affecting others. Let's see:</p>
    <h5>the new template.art:</h5>
    <textarea id="snippet-12" class="codearea">
    public class ?@class? {
        public Hp { get; set; }

      <h1> ART Story </h1>
    </header>
      <h2>XVCL era (2001 &ndash; 2012):</h2>
      <p><b>XVCL (XML-based Variant Configuration Language)</b>, an open source variability technique and tool was designed and built in 2001 with the collaboration of <b>Stan Jarzabek</b>, grand master of Code Clones and Software Product Lines and <b>Paul Bassett</b>, inventor of Frame Technology.</p>
      <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
      <h4>Software Product Lines (SPL)</h4>
      <p>
        Software product lines, or software product line development, refers to software engineering methods, tools and techniques for creating a collection of similar software systems from a shared set of software assets using a common means of production.<br><br>

        Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute defines a software product line as <br><br> <i>"A set of software-intensive systems that share a common, managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission and that are developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way."</i>
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>XVCL was developed in Software Engineering Lab at NUS (National University of Singapore). Initially, this work focused on variability management, to help domain engineers design generic, adaptable core assets, and to automated reuse-based product development. It is a uniform technique to manage variability in SPL core assets such as code, configurations, documentation, models, test cases, etc.</p>
      <p>XVCL has been applied to manage variability in SPLs in a range of application domains (command & control systems, business applications, games for mobile phones, Web portals), using variety of programming technologies (Java, ASP, .NET, JEE). The technology became popular in research and industry projects as well. (See Publications section)</p>
      <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
      <h4>Some of the XVCL achievements</h4>
      <p>
          Case studies[5][6] were showing that using XVCL managed code fragments gives a 50 - 65% code base reduction, and makes code much easier to manage.<br>
          In the ASP.NET case study[6] the findings show an estimated eight-fold reduction of development effort and time-to-market in creating a new portal by reusing the designed XVCL frames.
      </p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>VCL era (2012 &ndash; 2015):</h2>
      <p>As programming languages became easier to use and less strict in syntax. XML syntax seemed to become less popular and very restrictive compared to other options.</p>
      <p>I've been fortunate to join an internship in 2012 January at NUS School of Computing. Before, I have been studying and working in Hungary at the University of Szeged, mostly working with on, and researching Software Code Quality and Software Code Maintenance.</p>
      <p>During my internship in Singapore, working with Stan, we reimplemented XVCL as <b>VCL (Variant Configuration Language)</b> in an XML-free more user friendly and flexible syntax and conducted case studies with the outcome on Linux core code, Java Buffer Library and other projects as well. (See Publications section)</p>
      <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
      <h4>Some of the VCL achievements</h4>
      <p>
          Achieved 77.2% code reduction in the well-known Java Buffer Library by using VCL templates[2], making the code easier to read and enhance[x].<br>
          VCL is used today in industry for APS.NET web portal generation, has helped many projects which have won innovation and quality awards for development effort reduction and code stability improvements.
      </p>
      </div>

      <h2>ART era (2015 &ndash; ):</h2>
      <p><b>ART (Adaptive Reuse Technology)</b> is for research purpose. Built for you &ndash; <i>for the community</i> &ndash; to let you discover the potential behind this language and tool set and unlock the yet undiscovered potential in it.</p>
      <p>ART is not exclusively for programming and/or source code generation. It has been used for generating image files, RTF documents, descriptions of products etc.<br> We are trying to keep an open mind. Most examples here will be about source code as that is what we are good at, and it is easier to enhance the things we understand and benefit from.</p>

      <p>
          Achieved 61% code compression by refactoring cloned code instances into generic ART templates in Linux driver source code[1]. This allowed us to greatly enhance maintainability of the input driver code in Linux kernel code.
